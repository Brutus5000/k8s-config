= Findings on migrating to K8s

On this page we will document problems that we encountered when moving to a proper k8s setup.
The idea is to collect them and send them upstream to the respective projects so that it might be improved in the future.

== NodeBB

_These findings are not yet reported upstream._

1. All configuration **and** secrets are in one file: `config.json`. Therefore we can't use regular split of config maps and secrets and everything must be a secret.
1. The config.json can not be mounted into the pod from a secret. The installer fails on doing so.

warn: NodeBB Setup Aborted.
Error: EROFS: read-only file system, open '/usr/src/app/config.json'
----
1. Workaround: Build the `config.json` via script from an init container out of configmap and secret values.
